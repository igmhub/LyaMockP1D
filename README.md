# LyaMockP1D
Simple code to generate mock Lyman alpha spectra following 
McDonald et al. (2006)

These are independent skewers, i.e., there is no correlation between them.
Therefore, these should only be used in P1D analyses, not P3D or BAO.

You will find some tests and notebooks under examples/ .
